        <p>End</p>

<p>The ending is the beginning is the ending. 
Between these two poles is where his home is standing.</p>

<p>Is where and is when his heart begins its beating
Within walls of time with echoes which are fleeting.</p>

<p>From contradiction a question is grown breathing,
Lays a flat land of answers entombed and wreathing.</p>

<p>Choosing one births first steps, amounts in believing,
Though untrue it construes objects for my reaving.</p>

<p>The ending is the beginning is the giving. 
Between these two poles is where he tries his living.</p>
