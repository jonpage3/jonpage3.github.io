*This a place for me to post schoolwork*

The following is a paper I wrote for my last philosophy class in college, a long long time ago in the Spring of 2009. The class was devoted to the correspondence between Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz: ![leibniz](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/Gottfried_Wilhelm_von_Leibniz.jpg)
and Samuel Clarke, a supporter of Isaac Newton. ![newton](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/39/GodfreyKneller-IsaacNewton-1689.jpg)  

It has been a while so I don't entirely remember what the paper is about, but I think it has something to do with Leibniz's philosophical foundations for physical science, and how it appears in a prominent debate with a Newtonian.   

I have posted the document in various file formats. I began with a markdown version of my document, and converted it to html, odt, by using the following [bash script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/inls161/assignment-3-convert-some-documents-jonpage3/master/jonpage3-convert-docs.sh)
