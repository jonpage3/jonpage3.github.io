End

The ending is the beginning is the ending. 

Between these two poles is where his home is standing. 


Is where and is when his heart begins its beating

Within walls of time with echoes which are fleeting.


From contradiction a question is grown breathing,

Lays a flat land of answers entombed and wreathing.  


Choosing one births first steps, amounts in believing,

Though untrue it construes objects for my reaving. 


The ending is the beginning is the giving. 

Between these two poles is where he tries his living.
