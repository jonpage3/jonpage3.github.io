The golden city Pizarro,  
where was this now? At Farmacia Kennedy,  
the rain came down the building‚Äôs  
green face, stamped by a white cross,   
the symbol for passersby, vendors,  
shifting in garbage for any sort of thing.


The youth wandered diagonally  
across the street, and his caretaker  
followed pointing in that direction,  
responding to mumbled questions  
asked and answered by nothing.  Needing  
a machine, one to pump hot water for tea,  
she couldn‚Äôt walk much more like this,  
having barely stood after rising out of bed.  
Her red shirt worn smelt, just as the  
same socks since Saturday night,  
when the day is Wednesday,  
and left alone on the sidewalk.


From there he stumbled inside   
a home where times fall to the  
bedroom.  Dreams of Diego de Almagro  
were waiting down the hallway while  
the Pizarro brothers remembered   
drinking at a bar in Maciel, Vilcabamba;  
and the Almagristas, other men  
from Chile, stood idly outside the door.  
But for them it was pointless  
to be going on like drips of mud  
inked into glass, the plans of a dumb  
draughtsman, wearing shoes too tight,  
teeth too dirty, and trunks   
that couldn‚Äôt hold their bags.  
Past them in a corner Amaru   
sat, possessed by thoughts of Manco   
Inca--rejected and killed   
by other rejects--his judgement  
tangled by the events around him.


Arguments abound with excuses  
and explanations, someone mentions  
Cortes or one who stayed rock-solid,   
Moctezuma, convinced he  
was in the presence of Quetzalcoatl;  
no one needs to be told what  
happened to him.  The swift blur of  
colors and noises, no time for anxiety,  
the new deserts of consciousness  
rise in the brain to level themselves   
out--the pavement never dries.  
Swept along, they might follow  
Paullu's example and accept wherever  
the rocks settle.  Everyone should know  
this war is futile.  Yet one can  
never resist the likeness of this or that  
attribute. and conversations continue   
to the Rio de la Plata, looking   
for silver, only circling back, with   
emotions de Orellana must have felt,  
floating 2,000 miles down the Amazon.
