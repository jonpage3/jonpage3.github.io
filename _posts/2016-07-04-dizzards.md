Whether pails still hold milk,   
apostates push new carts of books   
where contrarians gather, palsied,   
fidgeting on the broken shell.    
But beneath, bleeding within the walls  
Like paint dripping down watercolor paper,   
lines made last.  Their edges remain crisp    
in repetition of similar stories,   
no difference between once or often.

So empty these documents,   
each that adds space. Inside will be  
the closing-in of walls, not a stretched   
spirit longer, wider, retaining   
the cracks we fall in, expanding the surface,   
cliffs that appear to energy blunted.    
Horizons continually follow without trouble   
suggestions poured at noon, and swallow  
their influence, spreading out a place  
for grey panic to take care,  
her problems too seriously.
