>Whether pails still hold milk, 

apostates push new carts of books

>where contrarians gather, palsied,

fidgeting on the broken shell.  
>But beneath, bleeding within the walls

Like paint dripping down watercolor paper,
>lines made last.  Their edges remain crisp 

in repetition of similar stories, 
>no difference between once or often.
