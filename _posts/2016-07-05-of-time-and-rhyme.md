# I

**End**

The ending is the beginning is the ending.   
Between these two poles is where his home is standing. 

Is where and is when his heart begins its beating  
Within walls of time with echoes which are fleeting.

From contradiction a question is grown breathing,  
Lays a flat land of answers entombed and wreathing.  

Choosing one births first steps, amounts in believing,  
Though untrue it construes objects for my reaving. 

The ending is the beginning is the giving.   
Between these two poles is where he tries his living.

**Confusion in Beginning**

Speak, I heard speak the other day.  
Speak loud: style is a manner of thinking.    
The way you lost and the new way. 

It is not enough to avoid a stay.  
The poison remains, stills the drinking.  
Speak, I heard speak the other day

Of the path to moving on and flays  
The old skin, leaves the corpse stinking.  
The way you lost and the new way.

The emptiness of a past portrays  
What only blind eyes get by blinking.  
Speak, I heard speak the other day

Of remembering what we may  
Remember. I can‚Äôt forget the ending,  
The way you lost and the new way. 

Keep this stack of notes and parlay  
Them for future acts of beginning.  
Speak, I heard speak the other day:  
The way you lost and the new way.

**Nuances of a Theme by W.B. Yeats**

*Though leaves are many the root is one;  
Through all the lying days of my youth  
I swayed my leaves and flowers in the sun.  
Now I may wither into the truth.*

Dead the crickets are in October.  
Sun-burnt face pale in Spring.  
The tired feet will rest tomorrow,  
After this is where we cling.

And it will, in its own way, in the end  
Become meaningless to you ---  
The interest in growing older,  
The new breed.
