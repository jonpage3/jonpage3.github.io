On the way to Flintwood Brazilaar Graybeal was attempting to educate the younger Sheets on the finer details of cattle speculation.  

> “To pull the strings of trade without manipulatin confidants makes as much sense as huntin a dead black hog at night.”

> “Cause it’s black right?”  Sheets asked.

> “No, listen.  Cause it’s dead.”
  
  For miles Brazilaar pontificated on what he called the truths of his revered cross-bred Shorthorn-Herefords: their pleasurable white faces, their sturdy upper bodies standing well on their toes, the peacefulness of their muscular bellows given their singular refinement, and consequently and most importantly the stability and quality of their meat-production.  The county infiltration of Jerseys, Guernseys, Ayrshires and Holsteins combined with the interest in dairying stimulated by the concurrent cheese making demonstrations didn’t mean a damn thing stacked against the undeniable Shorthorn-Hereford.  And anyways he had connections within the Board of County Commissioners, connections that even reached to the State Board of Agriculture, and they assured him that the newly employed farm agent was sympathetic to the viewpoints of a solid beef cattleman.  With the market skills Sheets would learn--pooling with others to short a particular breed, spreading rumours to drop the price even lower--anything could and would be done to destroy the foolish dairy farmers plaguing the county.
  
  >“Milk the fools from every teat,” Brazilaar said.
  
  Around Black Forge he shouted at his cattle boy to hold the pack, and they parked the chuckwagon.  Brazilaar stepped off hugging a salt barrel against his chest, and Sheets followed with a bucket of feed.  Sheets poured the feed before the steers, and Brazilaar scooped the salt with a half quart tin can, carefully measuring the amount on each feed pile.  He shook the dust off his suit and tightened his bolo tie.  They waited until the steers were finished.
