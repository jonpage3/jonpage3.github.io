Lambeth liked to talk.  He knew many stories.  His favorites involved himself.
     We were told his last church before he came here had died out after years of his pastoring, and that this shouldn’t be considered any fault of his own.  When he first began preaching there the church was already declining--the average age of the members must’ve been at least fifty-five.  Maybe he hadn’t visited the old folks enough, but did this slight to their sixty-year old children do anything to influence the eventual death of the congregation?  Probably in that town there were no jobs.  Any young person graduating high school did themselves a favor by moving away.  But still, people love and will do a good bit of talking.
