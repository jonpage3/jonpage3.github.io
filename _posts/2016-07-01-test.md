This is a test of a post; creating a post. We can move this to draft where it will be ignored by git.



To throw away the key and walk away,
Not abrupt exile, the neighbors asking why,
But following a line with left and right,
An altered gradient at another rate,
Learns more than maps upon the whitewashed wall,
The hand put up to ask; and makes us well
Without confession of the ill.  All pasts 
Are single old past now, although some posts
Are forwarded, held looking on a new view;
The future shall fulfill a surer vow,
Not smiling at queen over the glass rim,
Nor making gunpowder in the top room,
Not swooping at the surface still like gulls
But with prolonged drowning shall develop gills.
