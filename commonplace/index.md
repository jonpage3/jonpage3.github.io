**worstward ho**
Ooze back try worsen blanks. Those then when nohow on. Unsay then all gone. All not gone. Only nohow on. All not gone and nohow on. All there as now when somehow on. The dim. The void. The shades. Only words gone. Ooze gone. Till ooze again and on. Somehow ooze on. 


**Flaubert, from a July vacation in Vichy**
here the heat is one great fart-blast.  Mercury plus humidity means sweat-through clothes; underwear wringing wet; trickle-trickle between ass-cheeks; underarms phew!; shoes hell on feet; skin scorched; air stifling, gasp making, murderous. Frantically oppressive; the only breeze the panting of human breasts; every bourgeois metamorphosed into a hot-air furnace ... In short, the brain melts and animal spirits are disordered.  I feel as flabby as a dog's prick after coitus....
