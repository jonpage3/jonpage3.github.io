# Georg Christoph Lichtenberg

**from the waste books**

Do we write books so that they shall merely be read? Don't we also write them for employment in the household? For one that is read from start to finish, thousands are leafed through, other thousands lie motionless, others are jammed against mouseholes, thrown at rats, others are stood on, sat on, drummed on, have gingerbread baked on them or are used to light pipes.

Nowadays three witty turns of phrase and a lie make a writer. 

If countries were named after the words you first hear when you go there, England would have to be called Damn It.

The American who first discovered Columbus made a bad discovery. 

We do not think good metaphors are anything very important, but I think that a good metaphor is something even the police should keep an eye on...

# Worstward Ho:
Ooze back try worsen blanks. Those then when nohow on. Unsay then all gone. All not gone. Only nohow on. All not gone and nohow on. All there as now when somehow on. The dim. The void. The shades. Only words gone. Ooze gone. Till ooze again and on. Somehow ooze on.

# Flaubert's letters 
**from a July vacation in Vichy:**  
here the heat is one great fart-blast.  Mercury plus humidity means sweat-through clothes; underwear wringing wet; trickle-trickle between ass-cheeks; underarms phew!; shoes hell on feet; skin scorched; air stifling, gasp making, murderous. Frantically oppressive; the only breeze the panting of human breasts; every bourgeois metamorphosed into a hot-air furnace ... In short, the brain melts and animal spirits are disordered.  I feel as flabby as a dog's prick after coitus....

**on going to Paris to take a break from writing:**  
Once there, I swear I'm going to go in for some monstrous debauches, to restore my morale.  I'm longing for them.  Perhaps by sticking something up my ass I can give my brain a good fucking. 

**on research for Salammbo:**  
The military art of the ancients makes my head swim; I'm stuffed with it; I vomit catapults, have hoisting machines up my ass, and piss scorpions.

**From a letter to James Boswell Saturday, 16 November 1776:**  
I had great pleasure in hearing that you are at last on good terms with your father. Life is but short; no time can be afforded but for the indulgence of real sorrow, or contests upon questions seriously momentous. Let us not throw away any of our days upon useless resentment, or contend who shall hold out longest in stubborn malignity. It is best not to be angry; and best, in the next place, to be quickly reconciled. May you and your father pass the remainder of your time in reciprocal benevolence!
